# SwissSystem WebApp — Core Principles

1. **Views only**  
   Focus only on the UI layer. All data and behavior for views must come from **services** (no direct `DbContext`, repositories, or backend in pages).

2. **Mocked services with demo data**  
   Put all data access behind services living in **`SwissSystem.WebApp/Services/`**. Implement these as mocked services with **hardcoded pre populated static lists**. Create new service interfaces and classes in that directory when needed.

3. **Blazor + MudBlazor**  
   Build views with Blazor (Razor components) and use **MudBlazor** for UI (MudTable, MudButton, MudDialog, etc.).

4. **Compatibility with SwissSystem.Models**  
   Views and services must bind to and use types from **SwissSystem.Models**. Do not introduce view-specific DTOs that conflict with those models. If a type does not exist in SwissSystem.Models, add it there only after asking.

5. **Do not edit models or backend**  
   Do **not** modify:
   - `SwissSystem.WebApp/Models/**`
   - `SwissSystem.WebApp/DAL/**`
   - `SwissSystem.WebApp/Migrations/**`, or other backend/data code  
   If something in the views or mocks would require a model or backend change, or might cause incompatibility, **ask before making that change**.
   **Do** modify:
   - `SwissSystem.WebApp/Service/**`, to create missing interfaces and mock services or expand existing ones

6. **Language**  
   Write all **code** (identifiers, comments, commit messages) in **English**. Write all **user-facing text** (labels, buttons, messages, placeholders, page titles) in **Brazilian Portuguese** (pt-BR).
